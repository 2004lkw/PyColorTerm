# PyColorTerm
This is a set of functions you can use to give your terminal text color.
---
When you use the functions, use plain color names to identify what it is you want the colors and font types to be. 

EX:
  ```print(colortxt.colorstr("none","yellow","green","TESTING!"))```
 
I've included a test file to look at how things work but the colortxt file is self explanitory.
